For the course Principles of repurpusing of electronics i had to create a electronic devices out of recycled and repurpused eletornics. 
i am orinigly a psychology student with no preknowledge about electronics, so it was i really challanged myself with this courses. 
togheter with the teacher i discussed what might be a project that is on a level that i could understand and learn it in a easy and fast way.

In my project i created a Windchime device. in this picture below you can see how the protoype looks.

When i had to think of what kind of thing i was going to create i wanted to implement my psychological background to the project.
i thought of a product that creates the feeling of recognisiation, valuation and warmth.
the first idea that i had was to create a remote candle/light. which implies that when i am in the amsterdam and the person that has this candle at home is in boekarest.
than when i call the number that is conneted to that candle/light it would lit up.
after some discussion with my tutor for this course we came to the conclusion that it is nice to replace the candle/light with a fan that is stimulation a windcime.
